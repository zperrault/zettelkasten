# What to write down when you're reading to learn

Copy-paste is almost always bad. It is so easy to do you don't think about what
you're writing down. Better to put things in your own words or even better,
write down how the concepts form in your own mind.

It is helpful to start by knowing what you hope to learn or what you care about.
Then you know you should take notes on anything that pertains to that.

Things that are interesting to you are also good to jot down, as are things that
are tough to keep in your head.

I'm not sure what the author means by thing that "take up mental RAM". I assume
they read more complicated things than I do? Or perhaps if the text is quite
dense? Maybe if there are a lot of unfamiliar words. Using context to infer
meaning would take up "mental RAM" I suppose. I remember reading _Walden_ and
running into that. Just so much language I wasn't familiar with made reading it
difficult.
