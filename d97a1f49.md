# Get your work recognized: write a brag document - https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/

<https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/>

Your work isn't always as visible as you'd hope.

A brag document is a list of things you've done. While most obviously helpful in
making a case for promotion, this document can have other benefits also.

- Just remember what has even happened!
- Notice patterns
  - What am I most proud of?
  - Are there themes in the work I do?
  - What could have gone better?
