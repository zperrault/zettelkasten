# Zettelkasten â€” How One German Scholar Was So Freakishly Productive

[Source][original][^source]

[Niklas Luhmann][luhmann] was a very productive academic. He achieved his
productivity in part through his use of a "Zettelkasten". Luhmann's Zettelkasten
was a physical set of file cabinets.

The Zettelkasten or "slip-box" notes method relies on a heterarchy. Instead of a
single hierarchy, a Zettelkasten uses tags to group multiple notes across
multiple tags. In addition notes are linked together when relevant. This
combination allows the collection of notes to evolve into a powerful tool for
connecting ideas in addition to remembering information.
