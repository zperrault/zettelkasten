# MTA - Incident Response

Production error notifications and any discussion about a potential
outage/incident are filtered into the
[#mta-triage](https://postlight.slack.com/archives/C0146TTF63B) channel in
Slack. If something is deemed an outage/incident, an IR ticket is created in
Clubhouse and a [Dash](https://dashforslack.com/) channel is made.

As events happen and actions are taken they are recorded in the IR ticket and
Slack channel. If video calls are made, they are recored and the recordings are
linked in the IR ticket.

Once resolved, "Things Learned" is populated in the IR ticket and action items
are created as tickets in Clubhouse and linked back to the IR ticket as "relates
to."
